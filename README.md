# Fire Detection and Safety System – Business Context

## 1. Project Overview
The **Fire Detection and Safety System** is an IoT-based solution designed to enhance safety in homes, offices, and industrial areas.  
The system uses sensors to detect **smoke, gas leaks, or high temperature** and immediately sends **real-time alerts** to users and emergency services via mobile or web application.  

**Goal:** Reduce response time in fire emergencies and minimize damage or casualties.

## 2. Business Need / Problem Statement
Fire incidents cause major property damage, injuries, and loss of life every year. Traditional fire alarms only provide sound alerts, which are ineffective if no one is nearby.  

There is a need for a **connected, intelligent fire alert system** that notifies users remotely and automatically triggers safety measures.

## 3. Use Cases

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| UC1 – Detect Smoke or Fire | Detect smoke or a sudden rise in temperature through sensors. |
| UC2 – Send Real-Time Alerts | Send instant alerts to users’ smartphones and emergency contacts when fire or gas leak is detected. |
| UC3 – Trigger Alarm | Activate a local buzzer or siren to alert nearby individuals. |
| UC4 – Monitor via Dashboard | Monitor sensor data (smoke level, temperature, gas) via a web/mobile dashboard. |
| UC5 – Notify Fire Department | Optionally send data to the local fire department or emergency API. |
